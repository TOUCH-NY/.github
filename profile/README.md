# TOUCH - Together Our Unity Can Heal

**TOUCH** is a community-based public health organization that provides compassionate and effective services to our friends and neighbors in the Hudson Valley who are living with chronic illness to help them thrive. TOUCH’s Eating Well Nutrition Therapy program prevents hunger and promotes health for our members living with HIV and other chronic illnesses by providing nutritional education and counseling and healthy food to optimize health outcomes. We also offer case management to coordinate medical care and access to services. 

Our **Eating Well Nutrition Therapy, Get Fresh and Food Recovery Programs** improve health outcomes for our members and our community. TOUCH works with our partner organizations in Rockland Community Against Hunger (RCAH) to distribute food to over 35 area food pantries weekly. In 2022 the Food Recovery Program rescued over 1.2 MILLION pounds of food – feeding those in need and benefiting our environment.
